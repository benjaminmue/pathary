## How to Use This Roadmap

1. **Start with P0 issues** - These are critical and should be addressed immediately
2. **Work through by priority** - Move from P0 → P1 → P2 → P3
3. **Within each priority** - Security issues take precedence, then bugs, then enhancements
4. **This file updates automatically** - Every time an issue is created, labeled, or closed
